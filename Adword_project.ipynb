    "## 1. The Main Problem \n",
    "<p>Consider this scenario: You are employed at a digital marketing agency, and your agency receives a request from a major online furniture retailer. They are interested in evaluating your agency's expertise in running extensive campaigns for their entire website. Specifically, you have been assigned the responsibility of developing a preliminary collection of search campaign keywords focused on the sofas section. The client has provided a list of products for which they require keyword generation.</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>sofas</li>\n",
    "<li>convertible sofas</li>\n",
    "<li>love seats</li>\n",
    "<li>recliners</li>\n",
    "<li>sofa beds</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><strong>The brief</strong>: Considering the client's profile as a budget-conscious retailer known for frequent promotions and discounts, our keyword strategy should align with their target audience. We should prioritize keywords that emphasize affordability and value, moving away from luxury-oriented terms. Since our budget is limited, it's crucial to create a focused set of keywords that match exact and phrase match criteria precisely. This approach will maximize the relevance of our campaigns and ensure they reach price-sensitive customers effectively.</p>\n",
    "<p>Given the provided briefing, our initial task is to compile a list of words that, when combined with the mentioned products, would form effective keywords.. Here are some examples:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Products: sofas, recliners</li>\n",
    "<li>Words: buy, prices</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "          'prices sofas', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners', 'recliners prices'.</p>\n",
