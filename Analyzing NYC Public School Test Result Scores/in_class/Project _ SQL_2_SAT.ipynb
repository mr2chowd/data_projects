    "# SAT Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It assesses a student's knowledge and skills in reading, writing, and mathematics. The exam consists of multiple-choice questions and an optional essay section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT exam is divided into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading: This section evaluates a student's reading comprehension skills through passages and questions based on them.\n",
    "2. Writing and Language: This section focuses on grammar, sentence structure, and effective language usage.\n",
    "3. Mathematics: The math section assesses a student's problem-solving abilities and mathematical reasoning. It includes both multiple-choice and grid-in questions.\n",
    "4. Essay (Optional): The essay section measures a student's ability to analyze an argument and communicate their ideas effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of the SAT is scored on a scale of 200 to 800 points, resulting in a total score between 400 and 1600. The essay section is scored separately on a scale of 6 to 24.\n",
