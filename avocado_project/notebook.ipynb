A simple smashed avocado toast can be made with five ingredients: one ripe avocado, half a lemon, a big pinch of salt flakes, two slices of sourdough bread and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIt's no small feat that most of these ingredients are readily available in grocery stores. In this project, you'll conduct a supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in an avocado toast, utilizing the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish. The data is contained in `.csv` files in the `data/` folder provided.\n\nAfter completing this project, you'll be armed with a list of ingredients and their countries of origin, and be well-positioned to launch into other analyses that explore how long, on average, these ingredients spend at sea.\n\n![](avocado_wallpaper.jpeg)","metadata":{},"id":"32ec92a0-c21a-45b8-ac63-9f9c698a1291","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd","metadata":{"executionTime":8,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd"},"id":"339a6352-aed5-4b9e-a48f-1b91a7db9adb","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
