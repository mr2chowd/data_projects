World Leaders\n","\n","<p>Are you up for the challenge of classifying text, specifically tweets? In this notebook, we'll explore the realm of social media text classification and delve into the task of properly categorizing tweets from two prominent North American politicians: Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau.</p>\n","<p>Classifying tweets presents unique challenges in natural language processing due to their brevity. Additionally, various platform-specific conventions such as mentions, #hashtags, emojis, links, and short-hand phrases (ikr?) can make the task more complex. But fear not! We will overcome these hurdles and construct a valuable classifier that can distinguish between these two prolific tweeters. Let's get started!</p>\n","<p>To begin, we'll import all the necessary tools from scikit-learn. This includes data vectorization techniques like <code>CountVectorizer</code> and <code>TfidfVectorizer</code>. We'll also import essential models, such as <code>MultinomialNB</code> from the <code>naive_bayes</code> module, <code>LinearSVC</code> from the <code>svm</code> module, and <code>PassiveAggressiveClassifier</code> from the <code>linear_model</code> module.
