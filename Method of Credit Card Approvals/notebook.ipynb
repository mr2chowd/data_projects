Bank Card Applications\n","\n","Commercial banks receive a large number of applications for credit cards. Many of these applications are rejected for various reasons, such as high loan balances, low income levels, or a high number of inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is a tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming task (and time is money!). Fortunately, this task can be automated using the power of machine learning, and nearly every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will develop an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.\n","\n","- First, we will begin by loading and examining the dataset.\n","- The dataset contains a mix of both numerical and non-numerical features, with values from different ranges, and it also includes some missing entries.\n","- We will need to preprocess the dataset to ensure that the machine learning model we choose can make accurate predictions.\n","- Once our data is properly prepared, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to build our understanding and intuition.\n","- Finally, we will build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an individual's credit card application will be accepted.\n","\n","First, let's load and view the dataset.

In a typical credit card application, we expect to find the following probable features: `Gender`, `Age`, `Debt`, `Married`, `BankCustomer`, `EducationLevel`, `Ethnicity`, `YearsEmployed`, `PriorDefault`, `Employed`, `CreditScore`, `DriversLicense`, `Citizen`, `ZipCode`, `Income`, and the `ApprovalStatus`.
