Where are the old left-handed people?\n","\n","<p>Throughout history, numerous notable individuals such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie have been left-handed. However, a thought-provoking <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104043241418\">study from 1991</a> claims that left-handed people tend to die, on average, nine years earlier than their right-handed counterparts. The validity of this claim raises questions that we aim to explore in this analysis.</p>\n","<p>Using age distribution data, this notebook endeavors to determine whether the observed difference in average age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals can be solely attributed to the changing rates of left-handedness over time. We will leverage tools like <code>pandas</code> and Bayesian statistics to examine the probability of reaching certain ages at death based on reported hand preferences.</p>\n","<p>In 1986, researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki conducted a National Geographic survey with over a million responses, capturing information on age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. Upon analyzing the data, they discovered that the prevalence of left-handedness decreased with age - from around 13% for individuals younger than 40 to about 5% for those aged 80 and above. The researchers concluded that this age-dependence was primarily a result of the changing social acceptability of left-handedness, linking the rates not to <em>age</em> specifically but rather to the <em>birth year</em>. Consequently, if a similar study were conducted today, we would expect a shifted version of the same distribution as a function of age. Our primary objective is to assess how this changing rate impacts the apparent mean age of death for left-handed individuals. To begin, let's visualize the rates of left-handedness as a function of age.</p>\n","<p>This study relies on two datasets: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199_table310.pdf\">death distribution data</a> for the United States from 1999 (source website <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_tables.htm\">here</a>), and rates of left-handedness extracted from a figure presented in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1528408\">1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki</a>.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"source":["# import libraries\n","# ...

Final comments\n","<p>The analysis focuses on the substantial age gap observed between left-handed and right-handed individuals, which can be attributed to the changing rates of left-handedness in the population. This observation carries positive implications for left-handers, indicating that their sinisterness is unlikely to be a factor in premature mortality. Over time, the reported prevalence of left-handedness has risen from a mere 3% in the early 1900s to approximately 11% in contemporary times.</p>\n","<p>However, when comparing our findings to a previous study, a notable difference in the magnitude of the age gap emerges. Several approximations were employed, possibly contributing to this disparity:</p>\n","<ol>\n","<li>The death distribution data used was nearly ten years later than that of the original study (1999 versus 1991), and the data encompassed the entire United States, not just California, which was the focus of the initial research.</li>\n","<li>Extrapolation of left-handedness survey results to different age groups could have led to deviations from the true rates for those particular age cohorts.</li>\n","</ol>\n","<p>As a future step, it would be prudent to explore the potential impact of variability resulting from random sampling on the age difference. Conducting a study with a smaller sample of recently deceased individuals, applying handedness probabilities from the survey, and analyzing the resulting distribution could shed light on the frequency of encountering a nine-year age gap using the same data and assumptions. However, this detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the present study, though it remains feasible with the available data and tools of random sampling.</p>\n","<!-- Additional tasks could be included with three more blocks if desired. -->\n","<p>Concluding the investigation, a calculation was performed to determine the age gap that would be expected if the study were conducted in 2018 instead of 1990. Notably, the gap is considerably smaller due to the fact that left-handedness rates have not significantly increased for individuals born after approximately 1960. Both the National Geographic study and the 1990 research were conducted during a unique period when the prevalence of left-handedness underwent notable changes across the lifetimes of most individuals, leading to a stark contrast in handedness between different age groups.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"67"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Calculate the probability of being left- or right-handed for all ages\n","left_handed_probability_2018 = ...\n","right_handed_probability_2018 = ...\n","\n","# calculate average ages for left-handed and right-handed groups\n","average_lh_age_2018 = np.nansum(ages*np.array(left_handed_probability_2018))\n","average_rh_age_2018 = np.nansum(ages*np.array(right_handed_probability_2018))\n","\n","print(\"The difference in average ages is \" + \n","      str(round(average_rh_age_2018 - average_lh_age_2018, 1)) + \" years.\")"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
